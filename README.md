I'm a full stack developer working mainly with node and react/redux, I graduated from EPITA in 2018 and worked since as a full stack developer on web and mobile.

I am a React enthusiast and I also enjoy learning and trying new stuff, I started this portfolio project mainly to try [gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org), and learn more about SEO. I wanted to store my data with [gitConnected](https://gitconnected.com/)

The other tools I decided to try for the first time in this project is netlify for the deployment and tailwind css to experiment a different way to apply styles to components.
